# Bookmark Manager

Bookmark Manager is a Single Page Web Application for managing browser bookmarks. The front-end uses, RequireJS, backbone, and twitter bootstrap - the back-end runs on Node.JS. 

## A bit of history

A while ago I created a bookmarking app which was basically a hack that saved all bookmarks on a Google Docs spreadsheet. The app stopped working when the number of my bookmarks got too large. This made me decide to create a more polished app that other people could also use. The fundamental goal is to make Bookmark Manager useful and dead simple to use.


# Back End

The application back-end uses 2 models, Users Model and Bookmarks Model.

 - The Users Model API handles CRUD operations on users collection for both logged in users and guest users
 
 - The Bookmarks Model API handles CRUD operations on bookmarks collection for logged in users (demo bookmarks being the only ones accessible to the public)
 

## Users Model

### Logged in users

Logged users interact with the Users Model in several ways: 

1. When they view their account information (READ)
```
GET /user
```
  
2. When they edit their account information (UPDATE)
```
PUT /user/:id
```
  
3. When they delete their account (DELETE)
```
// read id from session
POST /user/delete
```
  
4. When they logout(Not a CRUD operation but we place it here for organisational purposes)
```
GET /user/logout
```


### Guest users (Back-end)

Guest users can interact with the Users Model in following ways: 

1. When they create an account (CREATE)
```
POST /user
```
  
2. When login (READ)
```
POST /user/login
```


## Bookmarks Model

### Logged in users

Logged users perform all available CRUD operations on the bookmarks collection: 

1. When they create a new bookmark (CREATE)
```
POST /bookmarks
```
  
2. When they edit a bookmark (UPDATE)
```
PUT /bookmarks/:id
```
  
3. When they delete a bookmark (DELETE)
```
DELETE /bookmarks/:id
```
  
4. When they fetch bookmarks (READ)
```
GET /bookmarks
```


### Guest users

Guest users can only view the demo page which reads the data from an account that I created: 

1. When they fetch bookmarks (READ)
```
GET /bookmarks
```
